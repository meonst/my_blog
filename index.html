                I am going to log my studies in this blog.<br>
                Although I have made web-apps such as <a href="https://min.hyeok.org/SILVER">Silver City</a> and <a href="https://disco-mountain-289802.df.r.appspot.com/">Industrial District</a>, <br>
                I feel like my understanding of the fundamentals of web programming is not even close to enough.<br>
                I am at a point where I don't even know what I don't know and that is why I am going to log my path of studying programming.<br>
                Hoping that I eventually succeed I hope this blog will help others understand what I have gone through.<br>
                I am going to take both the Foundations and Full Stack Javascript Course in <a href="https://theodinproject.com/">The Odin Project</a>.<br>
                I plan to update this page at least once a week until I get a Job, and once a month afterwards.

                I already feel like I know a lot more than a week before.<br>
                I have gone through 50% of the Foundations course in <a href="https://theodinproject.com/">The Odin Project</a>.<br>
                Also as a by-product, I finished the <a href="https://www.freecodecamp.org/learn/responsive-web-design/">Responsive Web Design</a> course except for the projects.<br>
                In hindsight I hoped I took this course before I started building my first web-app as It has been very helpful in my opinion.<br>
                I feel like I understand what my brother meant when he said I had no basics in web programming<br>
                Using ubuntu have not been easy due to a few problems. One being an internet issue that I still could not figure out why it is happening.<br>
                I believe there is a problem with ubuntu 20.04 and my PCI port since ethernet works just fine on windows or with a PCI-USB converter.<br>
                I failed to find any solution that works and thus for the meanwhile I will be using the PCI-USB converter instead.<br>
                Another problem is an issue with the <a href="notes/korean_in_ubuntu.txt">Korean input</a> on ubuntu.<br>
                ibus feels like it is reliable in most situations, however on certain websites such as Twitter, it eats up my words and leaves only the vowels behind, making it very difficult to use.<br>
                I am yet to find out what advantages Ubuntu(or Linux) provides so I am still looking forward to that.

                I have completed 65% of the Foundations course and made a google homepage clone(not functional).<br>
                Seeing at my percentage this week I wish to go a lot more faster, although the percentages given by the course is not linear, I hope i can concentrate a lot more this week.<br>
                I have found out some features of the google chrome developement tool. I've been using it for well over a year but I found the lighthouse feature very interesting.<br>
                Also considering those who are physically challenged while making a website feels a lot more important to me now.<br>

                I have completed 78% of the Foundations course, made a Rock Scissors Paper game in JS, and finished a few exercises.<br>
                Since my progress is not impressive to me, I am going to set a deadline to finish this course by next week, 2021-04-04.<br>
                While reading through the course, here are the habits I hope to carry with me.<br><br>
                1. Use the same naming convention for a single project.</h3>
                <h4>
                    I've been using snake_case for my personal projects for a while now, and planning on using it.<br>
                    But for other projects that require cooperation, I will obviously change to camelCase, PascalCase, SCREAMING_SNAKE_CASE or whatever is required.<br>
                </h4>
                <h3>2. Use self-discriptive variable/function names.</h3>
                <h4>
                    To easily identify what a variable stands for/what a function does(I've been doing this too)<br>
                    Further more, I wish to be able to write codes that are easy to understand through this <a href="https://blog.codinghorror.com/coding-without-comments">method</a>.<br>
                    This will connect to using comments only when necessary.<br>
                </h4>
                <h3>3. A single job for each function.</h3>
                <h4>
                    This is a new one. I've made some gigantic functions that does multiple stuff and having this pointed out,<br>
                    it made much more sense to have each function do one thing at a time.<br>
                    In addition, some presets for naming functions. For Example get_blahblah to get a value, calc_blahblah to calculate something, etc.
                </h4>
            <h3>
                Also there was this part talking about how a programmer thinks, which in my observation is just the same as how a mathematician thinks.<br>
                Divide and Conquer, Identify the problem and the desired result, stuff like that.<br>
                I've been doing this for years now so I guess thats a plus.<br>

                I am a day late in my deadline but I completed the Foundations course and will now be moving on to the Javascript course.<br>
                Since I now realize I didn't state this before, everything I make along the odin project will be all saved in a <a href="https://github.com/meonst/the_odin_project">github repository</a>.<br>
                I've made a few elementary level projects such as Etch-A-Sketch and a basic Calculator while trying to make good habits as a programmer.<br>

                I have started the JavaScript course which consists of 4 parts(JavaScript, HTML and CSS, NodeJS, Getting Hired) and finished 20% of the JavaScript part.<br>
                During these 20% I learned about object constructors, classes, factory patterns. I also made two small apps from what I learned, which are stored in my odin project repository.<br>

            이 블로그에는 제가 공부한 기록들을 적을 예정입니다.<br>
            제가 비록 <a href="https://min.hyeok.org/SILVER">Silver City</a> 과 <a href="https://disco-mountain-289802.df.r.appspot.com/">Industrial District</a> 등의 앱을 만들었지만,<br>
            웹 프로그래밍에 대해서 충분하다고 하기에는 거리가 먼 지식량을 가지고 있다고 생각하고 있습니다.<br>
            저는 지금 웹 프로그래밍에 대해서 내가 무엇을 모르는지도 알지 못하는 상태이기 떄문에 공부하는 과정에 대해서 적고자 합니다.<br>
            제가 성공적으로 공부를 이어나가기를 기원하며 다른 사람들이 제가 어떤 과정을 통해서 공부했는지 이해 할 수 있기를 바랍니다.<br>
            저는 일단 <a href="https://theodinproject.com/">The Odin Project</a> 에서 Foundations, Full Stack Javascript 코스를 수강하고자 합니다.<br>
            취직을 하기전까지는 일주일에 최소 한번, 그 후로는 한 달에 최소 한번 업데이트 할 예정입니다.

            벌써부터 저번 주에 비해서 더 많은 것을 알게 된 것 같은 기분이 든다.<br>
            <a href="https://theodinproject.com/">The Odin Project</a><br> 에서 Foundation 코스의 50%를 들었다.
            그 부산물로 <a href="https://www.freecodecamp.org/learn/responsive-web-design/">Responsive Web Design</a> 에서 프로젝트를 제외한 과정을 완료했다.<br>
            돌이켜보면 첫 웹 앱을 만들기 전에 오딘 프로젝트를 먼저 수강했으면 어땠을까 싶다.<br>
            이제는 형이 말했던 내가 웹 프로그래밍에 대해서 기본이 없어보인다는 말이 무슨 뜻인지 알 것 같기도 하다<br>
            Ubuntu 를 쓰는데 적응하는데에 여러 문제점이 있어서 쉽지는 않았다. 그 중 하나가 유선 인터넷 문제인데 아직도 그 이유를 찾지 못했다.<br>
            PCI-USB 컨버터를 사용하거나 Windows 에서 이더넷을 쓰면 문제가 없는걸로 미루어보아 Ubuntu 20.04와 내 PCI 포트 사이에 문제가 있다고 추정중이다.<br>
            인터넷에서 검색도 해보고 포럼에서 질문도 해보았지만 성공적인 해결책을 찾는데 실패해서 일단은 PCI-USB 컨버터를 사용할 생각이다.<br>
            또 하나의 문제점은 <a href="">한글 입력</a>에 관해서이다. 
            ibus 는 대부분의 상황에서 믿을만하다고 생각하지만 특정 웹사이트에서는 내가 입력을 해도 모음만 남기고 자음은 사라지는 경우가 빈번해서 사용이 불가능하다.<br>
            아직 Ubuntu(또는 Linux) 가 어떤 장점을 가지고 있는지 잘 모르겠지만 앞으로 기대하고있다.
